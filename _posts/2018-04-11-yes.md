There were infinitely many techniques I was applying for every problem I was facing. I was applying different approaches for each situation. When my parents get divorced I was searching for people to share my worries and get the right suggestions. Then as I understood that no- one can see the big picture except myself as I am the facer of the problem the suggestions could be very subjective. So, I have started to share my worries with myself and try to find the solutions in myself. In the physmath school I was working as hard as I could in order to get integrated to their community, as after questioning a lot I understood that this may be the most difficult, but the best way to become a real representative of that school. In the US I came to the point when I had an exact algorithm for dealing with my stresses. It was as simple as either changing the case I do not like, or changing myself at that particular case. In conclusion, as a person who believes that itâ€™s possible to transcend into the best version of ourselves, I consider the stresses and difficulties on this journey as usual ones. I see those as the opportunities of improving myself and converging to the best version of mine.khbk
