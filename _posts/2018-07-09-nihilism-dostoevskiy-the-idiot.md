### Nihilism

Before going into the analyses of the book, I would like to share the new perspective I have gained about the world's philosophy, when I was introduced to the word "nihilism".  In Wikipedia its stated that "Nihilism is the philosophical viewpoint that suggests the denial or lack of belief towards the reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value." While, this explanation made the boarder between nihilsm and existentialism very vogue. Due to [this](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/difference-existentialism-nihilism-absurdism/) article I was able to differentiate them.

**Existentialism** - is the belief that through a combination of awareness, free will, and personal responsibility, one can construct their own meaning within a world that intrinsically has none of its own.

**Nihilism**  - is the belief that not only is there no intrinsic meaning in the universe, but that it’s pointless to try to construct our own as a substitute.

I wanted to make a list of famous Nihilists still most of the ones I wanted to mention were already listed as existentialists.
(Must explore the difference further to understand Why)

**Absurdism** -  is the belief that a search for meaning is inherently in conflict with the actual lack of meaning, but that one should both accept this and simultaneously rebel against it by embracing what life has to offer.

*Superior Existentialists(Dane Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) was a theologian, German Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) an anti-establishment wandering academic, Czech Franz Kafka (1883–1924) a short story writer and factory manager, and Russian Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821–1881) a novelist, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre etc. ) *

### The Idiot 

This is the first novel I have read from Dostoevskiy. I am amazed by the tone that he is using to describe P. Myshkin. I fell in love with that character within the first pages. The character encapsulating all the factors converging to the ideal one. His transparency, analytical thinking, humbleness, intelligence and the deepness could not help me not to fall in love with him.
(In the beginning I was really enjoying the "maybe"-s he was using very frequently in his sentences). I have finished the novel 30 minutes ago and I am sitting with a complete mess in my mind, having a lot of questions that I can not find the answers to.  
Myshkin was the character I was searching in me for very long, and when it seemes to me that I have converged to the consciousness and self-purpose I have started reading this book. And the analogues that I was observing through inrospecting my ideal self and Myshkin's character were mind blowing. Those made me to enjoy the novel more.

This is certainly one of the greatest novels I have read!
