### My list of books that worth to be reread

<p>
In this article I will constantly share the books that I have enjoyed the most. Those were mostly the books that helped me to converge more to the answers that I have about this universe. 
</p>

<b>["How to create a mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_Mind) written by Computer Scientist Ray Kurzweil </b>
<p>
This book has helped me to be interested more in human decision making and learning. I have been contemplating on those questions through making parallels between human brain and AI models. As my interest grew after every single page and theory raised by the professor I have finally decided to pursue a Cognitive Neuroscience Degree in Germany in the near future.<br>
I recommend this book to every single person who doubts in the ability of human brain and the power of AI. This book gave me a big new breath and a very new dimension to explore the origins of life. The biggest question I am left with after reading the book is, to explore the difference between AI (conscious machines) and conscious homo sapiens.<br>
<ul>
<li>"Critics apply their linear intuition to information phenomena that are fundamentally exponential".</li>
<li>"Indeed we resolve ambiguities in much the same way that Watson does- by considering the likelihood of different interpretations of a phrase."</li>
<li>"We are looking for biologically inspired methods that can accelerate work in AI, much of which has progressed without significant insight as to how the brain performs similar functions. I know that our work was greatly accelerated when we gained insights as to how the brain prepares and transforms auditory information."</li>
<li>"It is interesting to note that the methods deployed in AI have evolved to be mathematically very similar to the mechanisms in the neocortex."</li>
<li>"Each neocortical pattern recognizer-indeed, each neuron and each neuronal component- is following an algorithm."</li>
<li>"Waking up the universe, and then intelligently deciding its fate by infusing (integrating) it with our human intelligence
in its nonbiological form, is our destiny."</li>
</ul>
<i>― Ray Kurzweil</i>

<b>[ "The Art of Loving"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Loving) written by Psychologist Erich Fromm</b>
<p>
I have read this book, after experiencing love. I have been experiencing something unsual and very tense, and I could not define it , as I have never experienced it before. Erich Fromm helped me to define my experience, and understand the deep and diverse roots of love.
<ul>
<li> "Modern man thinks he loses something - time - when he does not do things quickly. Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains, except kill it."</li>

<li>"If one is not productive in other spheres, one is not productive in the love either."</li>

<li> "If you love yourself, you love everybody else as you do yourself. As long as you love another person less than you love yourself, you will not really succeed in loving yourself, but if you love all alike, including yourself, you will love them as one person. Thus he is a great and righteous person who, loving himself, loves all others equally."</li>
</ul>
<i>― Erich Fromm</i>
</p>
<b>[ "The Outsider" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(novel))written by Philosopher Albert Camus</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
"I summarized The Stranger a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: 'In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death.' I only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game."
</li>
</ul>

<i>― Albert Camus</i>
<br>
<p>
So, the reason I have included this book in the list, is that I always wondered why people could have been judged for not having or showing their feelings and emotions, but not for faking those. For me, the stranger's pure and transparent analyses of his actions help me in some sense figure out and question certain behaviours of mine.
